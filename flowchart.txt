1. Importing the Packages required

2. Loading the BART model and Tokenizer - bart-large-cnn model(LLM model)

3. Function  extracting the text from image using OCR and LLM

	- converting the image from text using tesseract OCR
	- Tokenize the converted text using llm model
	- generate the ids using llm model
	- decoding the corrected ids using model tokenizer

4. define a folder to store and using the image

5. setting the specific type of image to be upload

6. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin

7. User uploading the image (text based or handwritten text image)

8. If method is get returns to index page 

9. If method is POST and then function ocr_core is used for extracting the text

10. Extracted text is processed and predicted corrected text using pre-trained LLM model

11. The Generated output text using LLM model will be - The original input text is “Machine Learning.” and the generated corrected text includes 
additional text that relates to machine learning concepts. 

Note : It’s important to note that the BART model’s output might not always be entirely accurate or contextually appropriate. 
It can “hallucinate” information or produce text that is a combination of learned patterns from its training data. 
In this case, the generated text seems to be a mix of accurate and inaccurate information related to machine learning concepts.

12. Final Outcome is display
